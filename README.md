   Enhance the "walk.js" script to include interactive features, data manipulation, or any specific functionality you want to implement for the application.

2. **Responsive Design:**
   Implement a responsive design using CSS to ensure the application looks good and functions well on various devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, desktops).

3. **Framework Integration:**
   Consider integrating a JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) to organize and manage the application in a more structured and efficient way.

### How to Run the Code:
1. **Create the "walk.js" file:**
   - Create a file named "walk.js" and add your JavaScript code (functionalities you want to implement) to this file.

2. **Place the HTML and JavaScript files in the same directory:**
   - Ensure both the HTML file (the one provided) and the "walk.js" file are in the same directory.
